<p class="HA">I love to watch Tik Tok memes.Tik Tok has a lot of songs that are fun to do and you can do duets with others. Im in grade 7. I love to play fortnite (add me: HB_GOOLYSLAP). The book im reading right now is Daniel X book 2. My favorite meme song is "Baby I'm Yours by Breakbot". But my favorite song is Sunflower.
     I play Apex Legends too but Fortnite is better. I'm a decent Console player and love my PS4. Don't worry, I don't play on Xbox. Also, I always tell bad joke and puns... Such as "What do you call a fake noodle? A Impasta." Get it?</p>
