<h1> All About Monali </h1>
 

 <p> Hi my name is Monali! I am an introvert I usually don't talk to others. I love to play volleyball, spend time with my friends and watch Netflix. My friends are so amazing. Malaiqa, Jenna, Mythri, and Saheer are some of my best friends. My favourite show is F.R.I.E.N.D.S and my favourite Disney movie is Tangled. I love the colour yellow and light blue because yellow reminds me of sunshine and light blue just makes me happy. I also love to bake.  My favourte subjects in school is gym and science. I enjoy playing volleyball, basketball, and ping-pong. My favourite dessert is apple pie with vanilla ice cream. I also enjoy doing crosswords and word searches. They're really fun! Summer is my favourite season because my birthday is in summer and it's nice and warm and you can eat icecream. My least favourite season is Winter because it's super cold and being cold is really uncomfortbale. Also, you get sick really easily. But since we live in Canda, we have to deal with it! </p>

     <p> I don't know what I would do without my friends. I factetime Malaiqa almost everyday afterschool. She is so kind and soo funny. When I am down she always tries to cheer me up. She is my bestest friend. Jenna is just so wierd (in a good way) She always makes me laugh and I can't stay mad at her. Her nickname is Chenna. Even though Mythri is in another class, we are still really close. I always text her and play 8ball with her on imessage games (I always win). Sabrina is so nice to me and she always eats! She is really fun to hang out with as well. Caswell is really athletic. He is also really good at makeing choclate chip cookies. Saindhavi (Sandy), Hashvitda (Hash), Shruthikaa (Shruthi) and Neha are also some of my close freinds. My friends are the best. Like I said before ,I can't live without them!</p>

<h1> Hobbies </h1>
 
 <p> I love to play volleyball and basketball with my friends during reccess. We don't play during winter but we still find other things to do. I also enjoy playing ping-pong. Whenever I go to my cousins house, we always play ping-pong. Even though I'm not good at ping-pong, I still enjoy playing it. Another one of my hobbies is looming. I really love loooming. It is really relaxing and it helps you calm down. Once your done looming, the end result is amazing! I made a scarf for my aunt's birhday and she loved it! Looming is really fun adn I enjoy it a lot. I also like to draw. Did you know when I was younger, the only thing that you would find me doing is drawing? Like looming, drawing is another way that helps calm down. Nowadays since  have a lot of homework it's hard to get free time but I still enjoy drawing.

<p> I love to read books! One of my friends Jenna actually has a library of books! Some of the best books I read come from her library. So far my favourite book is "The Way Back Home" by Allan Stranford. The book that I'm currently reading is called "The Hate You Give". Because I'm not finished reading this book yet I can't say that it's my favourite book, but I really think this book is going to become my new favourite. The whole reason why I actually started liking books is because of Jenna. The most recent book that I read is called "The Girl I Used To Be" I would give it a 10/10 rating beause it is really intresting and I loved it (Totally recommend)! If you can't find a book that you like Jenna will find the perfect one! Look below to see the trailer of the hate you give!
