    MY FAVOURITE BOOKS</h2>
             <h3 style='text-align:center;font-size:100%;font-family:comic sans ms':color:#9933FF>
 
        I love reading. It makes me relaxed. I've read many books. However my all time favurite books is the Percy Jackson series, Heroes of Olympus, Hunger Games, and Everything Everything. Percy Jackson is about Percy's Jackson life as a half-blood(aka.Demigod). This series of books is based on greek mythology. I love this book because I loved how the other connected greek mythology with the real life world. Even though the book had so much fantasy in it,the book had sense of reality too. Heroes of Olympus is another series I love. It is simalar to the Percy Jackson series. It has some new characters and some old characters from Percy Jackson. This series is based on Roman and Greek mythology. I really enjoy this series because it talks about each of the character perspective. Another series I love is the Hunger Games. This book is about a annual game that happens in a country called Panem. It is a competition on live tv. Players must kill each other in a arena designed like a forest and the last one standing wins. It is a Survival and Romance series. Everything Everything is a book I recently read. This book is about a girl named Madeline Wittier. She has a rare diesease called SCID. Which means she can't go outside.She must stay in a decotaminated house with her mom and her nurse. Her life has been the same evreyday until she falls in love with her neighbor,Olly. </P>

    MY HOBBIES </h2>
       
      <h3 style='text-align:center;font-size:100%;font-family:comic sans ms':color:#9933FF>

        <p>I have many hobbies. During my spare time I love to watch movies(especially MARVEL movies). I love Marvel movies.I would watch Marvel movies anytime. My favourite Marvel movie is Thor:Ragnorak. I also like making indian jewelery. I use a small plastic dome and wrap coloured silk thread around it. Then, I add diamond chains and different types of stones to decorate my earring. I also make tassels earrings and hoop earrings. I like to do DIYs in my spare time too. I like to read. I sometimes draw, paint or doodle random things when I'm really bored. Now a days, I barely have time to do any of these things because of homework.</p>

    MY TRAVELS </h2>
             <h3 style='text-align:center;font-size:100%;font-family:comic sans ms':color:#9933FF>
               <p> I have travelled a lot (Not like I have visited many countries but I have travelled for a reasonable amount). I have visited quite a few countries. I've been to DisneyLand(Calofornia), Las Vegas, Los Angelos, and other places when I was very little. When I was four years old,( I hardly remember) I visited Rome. My parents told me we went to the colosseum, Trevi fountain and other monumental places. They've said I have tried pizza and gelato. When I was 6 years old, I went to Disney World. I ate dinner at  Cinderella's castle and stayed in a amazing resort. I met lots of 'princesses'and other Disney characters. When I was 8, I visited Florida again. This time we went to Sea World and NASA. It was really fun. I went on a cruise in 2017. I really enjoyed my time on the ship. We stopped in Bahamas and saw the Alantis hotel. I got a chance to seat on the milliomn dollars chair there! I ate lots of food on the ship. Like pizza, cookies, and really fancy desserts. In 2018, I went to the Coca-Cola factory in Alanta,Georgia. It was really interesting. I got to taste over 200 flavors of Coca-Cola! I saw different types of bottles and learned the history of the Coca-Cola. Overall, these are my main vacations. I do travel to India often and do road-trips to the US. I like travelling...It's fun to explore different cultures and architectures of different countries!</p>
