<p>  Hi, my name is Shruthikaa Raviraj. I am currently 12 years old. My birthday is on September 6th. I'm in grade 7 and I had a great start in grade 7. I have awesome friends that will support me and care about me. My friends are Saindhavi, Neha, Hash, Monali, Nila and Alisa. I met Nila in kindergarten. Nila was one of my first friend.She is funny and creative. Then I met Neha and Alisa in grade 2. Neha is smart. She always wants to get 100%. She takes grades seriously. Alisa is good at art, she is like a n artist,I never met before. After, I met Saindhavi,Hashvitda and Monali in grade 3. Saindhavi is loud and funny. She acts weird sometimes but it is still funny.  Hashvitda will get hyper, if you give her too much candies.</p>

Well, I have two brothers and there names are Ratthesan and Nirrosan. Ratthesan is 18 years old and Nirrosan is 16 years old. With my family,I had traveled to many places and countries. Most of my cousins live in Canada but I also have cousins in Sri Lanka, Germany, France and England.I went to United States of America many times but to different places. <br>

 <h1> My Favourite Hobbies</h1>
   <p>I have many hobbies that I do at home. The first hobby is drawing doodles or landscape. My favourite part doing art is colouring. I always colour after I finish my drawing. If it is a nice weather,I like to play sports such as Basketball, Soccer, Badminton and etc. I usually play sports with my brothers. If there's a bad weather outside then I will read books. Sometimes if I don't want to draw, I like to watch movies. My one of my favourtie movie is THOR RAGNAROK.</p> 

   
 <h1> The Places I went Around the World</h1>
   
   <p> When,I was four years old, I went to France to meet my mom's step-brother.I tried there yummy food. I also went on rides.I don't know what the rides are called because I went to France, eight years ago. I went to USA and Great Wolf Lodge, when I was six years old. When,I was nine years old I went to Dominican Republic. I stayed at Dominican Republic for one week.</p>
