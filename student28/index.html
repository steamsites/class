  <h2> <u> <span              style="color:#5DADE2">Family and Friends</h2></u>
<p>My family consists of 4 people, my mom, my dad, my brother and me. My mom is really nice and caring. My dad is funny, it's really fun when I mess with him with snapchat filters. My brother, Austin, may be annoying but I love him. My friends are Hash, Shruthikaa, Neha, Saindhavi, Nila, Monali, Dini, Shath and many more people. These people are really funny and make me laugh. When I'm sad, they cheer me up. Hash is really funny, she picks up my lunch when I forget it outside. Shath is a person I can rant to when I'm feeling troubled. Dini is so fun to be around, she's honestly so adorable and someone I can joke with. The rest of my friends are great and I can write all about them but it would be too long. </p>

    <h2> <u> <span
                   style="color:#FEFA77">My Hobbies </h2> </u>
     <p> My hobbies include drawing, painting and creating art. I go to art class, I oil paint. I've done more than 3 paintings, I usually paint landscape, people or objects. It's really fun and calms me down. Although, I enjoy it, it sometimes frustrates me. Since I don't have enough time to do my homework.</p>
      <img class="art-image wrap-image"src="https://media.giphy.com/media/SM6iuxDDFqH0Q/giphy.gif"/> <p>I also enjoy playing volleyball, basketball inn my free time like in the summer. I'm in the girl's intermidate basketball team. I also do swimming lifeguard, I'm currently in Bronze Medallion. I'm really scared and nervous because I have an exam this week on December 21st. Even though, I dislike doing rescues and stuff like that, swimming is actually fun. I've made many friends, for instance Bella, Catherine, Ryan, Isabella and Brandon. I hope I pass Bronze Medallion. Update: I passed the exam! I know have to do First Aid Standard, which is 9 hours. I also love hanging out with my friends, sometimes school isn't fun but sometimes it is. </p>
    <p>  I also like to listen to music, when I'm drawing or doing homework. I usually go on spotify and listen to k-pop or pop songs. Some of my favourite kpop groups, that I enjpy listening to is, stray kids, BTS, red velvet, txt, and etc. I really like k-pop, since there's like different types of songs, it can be sad, or happy. It's just really interesting listening to another language rather than english. For example, here's a link of one of my favourite songs. STAN STRAY KIDS PLEASE!!!!!1111 </p>

     <p>In August, for the first time for in forever, I flied out of Canada, to Cancun, Mexico with my family and aunt's family. We stayed there for a week. It was really fun and was a great experience. On the first day, we had to wait at the lobby for our rooms to get ready. It was scorching hot in Mexico, the thing was was that when our rooms were done preparing. We were expecting for a cool, and cold room but the ac was broken, not to mention the toilet was also broken! It was such a disappointment for a 5-star resort. </p>

        <p>We went swimming everyday, let me remind you, don't go swimming for like 5 hours because you'll get really sunburnt and it's really painful. At least, I wasn't as bad as my dad, he looked like a tomato. There was a buffet, where you would get to go for breakfast, lunch, dinner and etc. You would also have different themes for dinner, for instance, seafood, steakhouse and etc. Near the middle of the week, this tour guide showed us some activites, packages to do in here. We chose to go visit Chichen Itza, and to the cenote, "Ik Kil". I learned a lot about the history of Cancun, Mexico and Chichen Itza. I observed the pyramids and old ruins, it's a great place to take pictures and make new memories. </p>

        <p> It was my first time, going to the beach and feeling the sea water. The groud was really like rocky and full of coral. I did went to the beach before, but I was a baby/toddler that time, so I can't remember the experience. It was kinda scary since there was fishes and like a tiny shark in the water. I kept clinging to my aunt, Maryanne, but I heard salt water is like good for you. I kept gulping water and let me tell you this, it stings your eyes. Mexico was so much fun, I definitely got to bond with my family more.</p>

        <h2> <u><span
                   style="color:#76D7C4">Books I've Read </u></h2>
          <p> I really enjoy reading in my free time and in class. One of the current books that I've finished reading is called the Astonishing Color of After by Emily X. R. Pan. When I first started the book, it was really good but at the middle of the book it kind of got boring, never the less I still continued reading. This book gave me more knowledge about the mandarin, taiwnese culture, since the main character is part white and part asian. Leigh's mother sadly died from suicide, now Leigh's mission is to find her mother since she's a bird now. She travels to Taiwan to meet her grandparents, who Leigh's mother is hiding from Leigh. This book also includes romance, as she and her bestfriend are in a conflict with eachother. Through the book, they end up knowing their own feelings with no denial. I love this book, it has a combination of romance and adventure. I give a rating of 9/10 and reccomend this book to teens who are interested in adventurous, slow books.</p>
