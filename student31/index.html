      <p> Hi, I'm Allison and I'm majestic. ;)
        <p>I'm 12 years old, born in Canada and I'm in 7th grade.
          <p>My birthday is March 14th, 2006. I was born in a hospital called North York General Hospital.</p>

            <p>Some hobbies I like to do is Badminton, visual arts, desiging virtual attire, reading, and just do whatever when I'm bored.</p>

              <p>My favourite healthy foods are strawberries, peaches or any fruit that is sweet. My favourite food of all would probably be sushi. My favourite type of sushi would probably seem plain to you, but I like salmon sashimi.</p>

                <p>Stuff that I can't live without would be my family, because I love my family members with all my heart. God because he's real. My electronics and wifi, because I play games or I watch YouTube. I can't live without friends because I like to have a social life. Lastly, I can't live without my house because without a house, I wouldn't be able to take care of myself.</p>
                  
                  <p>My favourite subject at school would probably be visual arts, literacy, or lunch time. (Lunch time is a subject, by the way.)</p>
