<p style="text-align:center;font-size:140%">HI! My name is Malaiqa. I'm in grade 7. I like volleyball and food. I love <b>COOKiES</b>. I'm a happy person. I am an extrovert but kinda socially awkward to new people. My favourite book is The Have U Give. My favourite colour is yellow because it reminds me of happiness and smiles. I love my friends, they're all so funny and are always there for me. I like to talk to my friends and laugh A LOT. My favourite subject is science because I love space. My favourite Disney movie is Tangled. AH! I <b>LOVE</b> TANGELED! My favourite tv show is Friends because its so funny. </p>

  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:120%">My best friends are Monali, Mythri and Sabrina. Monali is very intelligent. Mythri is hilarious. Sabrina is so much fun. My other best friends are William, Caswell, Saheer and Chenna (aka Jenna Margaret Mackenzie). William is always there for me. Saheer does stupid stuff. Caswell is really athletic. Chenna is very awkward but thats alright. My bestest best friend is @maryam_h1767. We have been best friends since second grade. Sadly, she moved away when we were in fifth grade but we still text almost everyday. I miss her so much. Of course,  I love my parents. They're the #1 reason that I am who I am and I'm so greatful for them both. Over the past year, I think I've grown up a lot. I kinda found myself this year and learned what I like and dont like. I've learned a lot this year about school stuff and friendship stuff and social stuff. I think over the past year I've gained more confidence but also more insecurities. I know what I like and dislike about myself and I'm almost happy with how I am.</p>
