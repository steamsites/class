   <h1> Technology</h1>
   <p> One of the greatest inventions and is used for almost everything. Entertainment and also makes people lazy. Technology includes cell phones, ipads, computers, laptops. Most people think apple is the best but they are wrong, samsung is better. You can find anything by using technology, I love technology and samsung is better than apple. Many things on technology is making us very lazy by making apps like uber eats, skip the dishes, and google home. We are not cooking our food and just waiting for our food at our houses. Google home makes our life easier by doing many things for us such as turning on the microwave, and turning on the oven. </p>
