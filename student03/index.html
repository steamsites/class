<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>Bluefur/Bluestar had a sister named Snowfur. They had a very close bound.</p>
<p> Bluefur fell in love with a tom named Oakheart.Oakheart was a River-Clan cat, so their love was forbiden. One day Bluestar was expecting kits. But, she had to bring her kits to River-clan (give up her kits) because if she's taking care of her kits, then she can't become deputy. If she isn't deputy, then an evil cat named Thristleclaw will!! So she brings her 3 kits into River-Clan, but one of them, Mosskit, dies. So her two other kits, Stone-kit and Misty-kit, were raised in River-Clan, and Bluefur became deputy, then the leader of Thunder-Clan.</p>

<h2>Moments of her life</h2>
<p>Bluefur's sister, Snowfur went across the Thunderpath (road) and got killed by a monster (ran over by a car). This made Bluefur feel sad everytime she went to the Thunderpath.</p>
<p> During her time as a leader there was a prophacy, "Fire will save our clan". One day, there was a forest fire that destroyed Thunder-Clan's camp. This made Bluestar loose faith in Star-Clan and everyone else.</p>
<p>During the time when Tigerclaw was deputy, at some point in time, Tigerclaw atempted to kill Bluestar so he could be leader. Tigerclaw failed and was kicked out of Thunder-Clan. This made Bluestar start to have trust issues.</p>
<p>There were some dogs that were going to destroy Thunder-Clan. So, to help chase away the dogs she sacerfised herself to save the camp. Before she died, she made peace with Star-Clan and talked to Stonefur and Mistyfoot (her kits) one last time.</p>
