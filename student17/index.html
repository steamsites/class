    <p class="txt">My name is Saheer and I was born on octobor 8th. I live with 3 other people. My dad,mom and my brother. I have many interests in my life as a matter of fact. I love to listen to music as most people, but out of everything to choose from, I would be in my chair, gaming. Later on in my life, im heading towards being an I.T it stands for Informational Techonology. I want to work as that because of the environment I would work in. I would be on my laptop or pc and working which is what I like to do I guess.

  <h2 class="What i enjoy doing" style='text-align:center;font-size:250%;font-family:Comic Sans MS'>What I "enjoy" doing</h2>
  
  <p class="enjoy">What do I enjoy doing you might ask? Well, as i mentioned before, I love to play on my gaming pc. And also, even though this isnt necessarily what i enjoy doing, but i love it when you guys follow my instagram! Click on this link to go to my family friendly instagram page! Now then. I'm not that kid who sits down on his pc playing games all day. Over the summer, I usually go to a soccer team or go outside ti play different sports with my friends or simply go outside to talk to my friends and maybe go to the mall. Pretty boring right? That's my life.

  Ok. Who cares about my life? No one really does so let's talk about the games that I play. Honestly, you would think that i would say "Fortnite", but Fortnite is absolut garbo. In my personal opinion, i think that is a game that should be for kids that cant handle real games. Now then, the games that i play are probably the competitive games that older people play. It's known as "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege" another game i play is also called "Counter Strike Global Offensive." 
Both of those games are FPS games. Fps can stand for two things. "Frames Per Second" or "First Person Shooooooooooting"  and yeah. Bothe of hose games are First person shooting games. My mom always comes to my room and looks at my pc, then she always asks why I play these kinds of "Violent" games. All I could tell her is just because It's not like fOrTnItE and its actually fun and competitive. Honestly, don't even ask how much money I spent on games ;)
