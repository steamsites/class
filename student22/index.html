   <p> Hello my name is Ehsan. I love basketball, sleep and just having fun in general. I am a type of person who likes funny things and I enjoy my life as much as possible. </p>

   <p> The video games I like are Fortnite and NBA 2K18. I like them because you could play with your friends and talk to them when your playing. Also basketball is my favourite sport and I really enjoy shooting games. </p>

    <p> I love the weekends and I am always looking forward to them. I really hate that the weekends are only two days especially because those days pass by so fast.They are very good days even though there not that long, I just enjoy the 48 hours as much as possible. I try to spent time with my family a lot in the weekends. I play video games in the weekend, play basketball, and spent time with my whole family and I really enjoy doing all of that. </p>
