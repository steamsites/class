  <p class="font-style1">STEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics. The two people who probably personify STEAM are the Renaissance figures Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Although these fierce competitors were known more as painters
    and sculptors, they were also renowned as inventors, engineers, and scientists. </p>

  <p class="heading font-style1">Why is STEAM important?</p>
  <p>STEAM is important because it pervades every part of our lives. STEAM activities provide hands-on and minds-on lessons for the student. Making math and science both fun and interesting helps the student to do much more than just learn.</p>
