               Lonzo Ball was selected with the 2nd overall draft pick of the 2017 NBA draft. Magic Johnson, the president of basketball operations for the Lakers, billed Lonzo as "the new face of the Lakers." Lonzo Ball was named the league MVP during the 2017 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas. He had limited playing time in his rookie season due to his injuries. Breaking Lebron James' record of being the youngest player to achieve a triple-double by five days, Ball became the youngest player to achieve a triple-double at the age of 20 years and 15 days. In the 2018-2019 season, Lonzo went through a surgery which limited his playing time, but he had increased his strength, mostly in his upper body during the time he wasn't playing. This had improved his durability which made him a better defender. Lonzo Ball was selected for the Rising Stars game but was ruled out again because of an ankle injury he had gotten during the game against the Rockets on January 19, 2019. Watch the following video to see the best of Lonzo Ball so far in his 2018-2019 NBA season.
