    <h1> All About Me!</h1>
    <h2> My Favourite Activities </h2>
      <p1> I like to do Taekwondo, Figure Skating, and Baking. I love to do Taekwondo because when I am angry or stressed, it's one of my ways to unwind and let it all out. I like to do Figure Skating because ever since I first saw the Winter Olympics, I have wanted to move as gracefully on the ice as the pros.</p1>

    <h2> My Talents </h2>
    <p2> After experimenting a lot at home and at school, over time, I have found out what my talents are. One of them is my flexibility. It is true that most young people are flexible, but I can do some pretty crazy things! Next, I can BAKE!! I love to bake and cook, and I have figured out that I have a talent for it! Another talent that I have is my strength. I can lift some of my friends at Taekwondo, and can do push ups with some of the little kids on my back!
