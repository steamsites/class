<p class="font-style1">STEAM is a new and exciting movement in education that meets the needs of a 21st century economy. The acronym stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and math and encomposes most of the key components that many employers, educators, and parents feel as important for students to thrive in the present and rapidly approaching future.</p>

<h1 class="heading font-style1">STEM vs. STEAM</h1>
<p>In 
  recent years, there has been much talk about incorporating STEM programs in our schools. The reasons being that our students will be able to take on the future job market, which will mainly contain jobs in science, technology, engineering and math feilds. Therefore, there has been an increased investment in STEM initiatives in schools such as robotics programs, coding clubs, hands-on exploration, and stem based projects. However, many people elt that the critical process os creativity and innovation was missing from STEM learning initiatives. The new thought was that STEM programs may have more experiential learning opportunitites, but they are limited to only science, technology, engineering and math. Our future jobs would require so much more than just understanding these areas--it requires applicaiton, creation and ingenuity.</P>

<br>
<p>This is where STEAM comes in. STEAM takes STEM education to the next level. It simply allows students to connect their learning in these critical areas with arts practices. STEAM is said to remove limitations and replaces them with wonder, critique, inquiry, and innovation.</p>

    <h2>We have been doing many exciting activities and projects in STEAM. Check out what we've done so far.
  </h2>
  
  <p>Our first activity involved a set of challenges that involved the use of an apple. Challenge 1 was to build a tower using an apple and school supplies found in the library. The goal was to build the tallest tower possible with an apple perched at the top. We then measured the towers to see which group made the tallest tower. </p>

<p>Challenge 2 was called Apples Annihilator. In this challenge, we used apples and school supplies to build an apple wrecking ball to "annihilate" markers that were positioned to stand up.

  <p> Challenge 3 was called Apples A-Head. In this challenge, groups used school supplies to create an apple carrier that can be worn on your head and used to compete in an Apples A-head Relay Race. One of the rules in this challenge was that the apples cannot be fastened onto the carrier in any way.

  <h2>Ozobots</h2>
<p>Ozobots are little toy robots that are programmed to identify lines, colours and codes on both digital surfaces and physical surfaces through its sensor. Our students got to try them out during STEAM class as they tried out different lines and colour codes to get their Ozobots to travel.</p>

  <h2>Building Websites</h2>
 <p> One of our longest projects in STEAM has been learning HTML and CSS to make our own websites. Students were introduced to the html and css programming basics and they then started to build thier own websites. </p>
 <p>If your interested in learning to make a website with HTML, you should check out the HTML Tutorial video posted below.</p>
