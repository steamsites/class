      <p1 style="font-size: 150%; font-family:Comic Sans MS"=>Hi, my name is Caswell. I love playing sports. The different sports I play are volleyball, soccer and basketball. I like going outside and playing with my friends. Some of my friends names are Saheer, Joe and Karan. Video games are one of my favourite hobbies. I love Fortnite, {that was before when I could play it} I also love Rocket League, NBA 2K 19 and Call of Duty. That's just a little bit about me.</p1>
      <h2 id="poem-header"style="text-align:center"> The perfect poem </h2>
      <p id="poem"> Roses are red<br>
         Violets are blue<br>
         Poems are hard<br>
         Bacon is Mmmmm.

      <h3 id="sport"> My favourite sport: Volleyball </h3>
      <p3> As you can see from the title, my favourite sport is volleyball. I love volleyball. Eventhough I'm not on a rep volleyball team, but I'm on a team for my school. I play well during school. I play the position setter, the person that passes the ball to the hitter. The hitter spikes the ball at the other team. Setting is a very stressful position. You need to rely on your passers to pass you a good ball to be able to set the hitter. If they don't give you a good ball, its hard to set the hitter. I love volleyball just because its so satisfying when you set the hitter and they hit in the other teams face. Thats why volleyball is my favourite sport.</p3>
