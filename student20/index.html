              Hi my name is Jenna! I love reading and drinking tea. My close friends are Eden, Malaiqa, Monali, Thushani, and Sadie.</p>
  
            <p>  My favourite book is The Hate U Give By: Angie Thomas. I am so excited as I am meeting Angie! She is going to sign my book and be talking about her new book. I will also be purcashing her new book when I meet her. I am sooooo excited!! I am a introvert and I usually sit alone reading with a cup of tea and I'm ok. My favourite type of tea is herbal tea so, mostly fruit teas. However I do enjoy some nice plain teas aswell! As a kid I loved reading and my mom made me read every day. My family loves animals and I have six. I am in grade 7 and my favourite subjects in school are Literacy,  History, and Science! I also love writing and would love to publish something one day. My favourite type of food is Italian (like pasta) ,and I also like eggs! </p>

  <p>  I have major ornithobia and I'm terrified of birds. They are so vicious and if they come anywhere near me I will run far away. I developed this fear when I was 5 years old. And have had many bad encounters with birds. I have been attacked by segals 3 times, geese 4 times, and I watched my sister get attacked by a giant swan. Through out all of these near death encounters I did nothing to trigger the birds.I got bit by a goose once and one stole my jacket.</p>
