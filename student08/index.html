  <h2>

<p>Went to the store,
Sat on Santa's lap.
Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of trash.

<p>He said all you need is to write them a song.
They haven't heard it so don't try to sing along, so don't sing along...
Monica, Monica, have a Happy Hanukkah.
Saw Santa Clause, he said 'hello' to Ross.

<p>And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowaaaaaaaayaaaaaaaaay. 
And Rachel and Chandler,
blakdndjangleeeerrrrr 
 <p> MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!<p>I C O N I C  Q U O T E S : 
    <p> HOw YOu DOin?
    <p> I went to that tanning place your wife suggested
    <p> She's your lobster!!!!!!!
      
      <p> Popular friends opinions:
      <p> Everyone is debating wether or not Ross and Rachel were on a break. Well heres your answer: yes, they were on a break. If someone said to me "I think we should take a break" I would definitely think they're breaking up with me. I feel like Ross felt the same way so thats why he did, what he did. Also Rachel knows that Ross H A T E S   Mark so why was she with him in the first place?!?!?!?!? Also this is also Ross' fault for moving on so quickly. The day that he "broke up" with Rachel he decided that it was perfectly fine to be with anothor girl. Lastly, it took only one person to break up their relationship and this person is Gunther. He had no right to tell Rachel that Ross was "cheating" on her. It was Gunther who broke up Roschel. Not Ross, not Rachel or the girl from the copy place.

  <p> F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is one of the greatest shows ever created. It is filled with iconic quotes, laughs and, tears. Many lessons are taught throughout the 10 years that the show was filmed. Not only is it one of the greatest tv shows of all time it also has the greatest theme song. "I'll be there for you". Originally written by The Rembrandts the song was later used for the show. I have decided to bless your day with the lyrics of the theme song:
    </p>
    <p>So no one told you life was gonna be this way
Your job's a joke, you're broke
Your love life's D.O.A
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month
Or even your year, but
I'll be there for you
(When the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you
(Like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you
      ('Cause you're there for me too)</p>
    
    <p> your welcome <p/>
