         <h1>Poems about Dogs</h1>
         <p>My Shelter Days are numbered ten.
Ten more days until my end.

My Shelter Days are numbered eight.
Please adopt me. Change my fate.

My Shelter Days are numbered six.
Adopt a pet week, still no one's pick.

My Shelter Days are numbered four.
Four more days and then no more.

My Shelter Days are numbered two.
Someone will take me, I just don't know who.

My Shelter Days are numbered none.
I know I'm finished, then you come.

My Shelter Days are over, done,
Because you, my master, took me home.

(Courtney Bailey,
The Final Countdown)
      
           The dog barks backward without getting up.
I can remember when he was a pup.

         <p>  But now, my bark a ghost in this strange scentless air
I am no growling cicerone or cerberus,
           But wreckage for the pound, snuffling in shame (Weldon Kees) </p>
