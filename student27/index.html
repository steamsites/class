    <a name="Books I've Read" />
<h2> <u> Books I've Read</h2></u>

<p>I have read many books. My favourite books are the Percy Jackson series, Hunger Games and Heros of Olympus. I have many other favourites. The Percy Jackson series is about Percy Jackson's adventures as a demigod. It is about Greek Mythology.<br>
  <br>
The Heros of Olympus is also about Greek and Roman Mythology. The Heros of Olympus is about when one of the members of the Roman and Greek camps switch and have their memory wiped. <br>
  <br>The Hunger Games is about one girl and one boy from each of the twelve districts compete in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are filmed on live TV. These are some of my favourite books/series.</p>
